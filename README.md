# Audio_Player_C#
An audio player with a beautiful(IMHO) graphical interface. The program allows you to select (open) a folder with audio files for further playback. Ability to adjust the sound volume.    
The following options should also be implemented:  
– pause;  
– playback;  
– rewind tracks;  
– track playback time;  
– display the list of tracks;
